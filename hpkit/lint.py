"""HP PPL linter: catches, before you compile, what the Prime's compiler
refuses to explain.

The Prime's compiler prints `syntax error` and points at a line. It does not
say what is wrong with it, so a mistake as small as one variable too many in
a LOCAL statement costs several compile-and-look rounds. Every rule here
comes from an error measured on a real calculator, not from reading a manual,
and it is an ERROR only as far as that measurement reaches. Where a rule's
pattern goes further, to cases nobody has run, it is a warning, and the
finding says so.

    hpprime lint FILE.hpprgm [more files or folders...]
    hpprime lint ppl/ --quiet      # errors only, no warnings
    hpprime lint A.txt B.txt --set # the files go onto the calculator
                                   # together: exported names that would
                                   # clash, and calls none of them defines

Output is compiler-shaped:  file:line: level: rule: message [fact, label]
The label is how the finding is known, in docs/format.md's words: G2 or
emulator where the case was measured, unverified where the rule reaches past
the measurement. A rule that comes from no fact ends in [no fact].
Exit code 1 if there is any ERROR.

A call to a name that is not a PPL name, from the documentation's list in
docs/commands/names.tsv, and that the program does not define is flagged as
unknown-name: a warning for a file on its own, because it may be calling a
function another program exports, and an error with --set, where all the
files that go together are in view.

What this deliberately does NOT flag, because each was checked on hardware
and found legal:

  - RETURN inside a FOR or a REPEAT.
  - locals made of letter + digit (r2, y1, L12).
  - several locals given initial values on one line.

They are listed so nobody "fixes" them back in.
