"""The Virtual Calculator: install into it, and read back what it has.

    Documents\\HP Prime\\Calculators\\<instance>\\

is the emulator's **own file system**, not a mirror. This is the opposite of
the Connectivity Kit folder of the same shape, which is a mirror and installs
nothing -- see deploy.md. Measured on 2026-09-06 against the Virtual
Calculator 2.4.15515, by copying a `.hpprgm` that `hpprime write` had
generated into an idle instance folder:

  - it appears in the Program Catalogue on the next launch,
  - its source arrives intact, the editor's Check says "No errors",
  - it runs: the test program returned 385, the sum of squares 1..10,
  - an `.hpappdir` copied the same way appears in the Application Library.

Three rules came out of the same session, and the tool is built around them:

  - **The folder is read at launch.** A file copied in while the emulator is
    running does not appear until it is restarted. This is why `install`
    refuses to copy into a running emulator unless you pass --restart.
  - **Files it does not know are left alone.** A second program copied in
    mid-session was still there, byte for byte, after a clean exit.
  - **It writes back.** After the calculator compiled the program, the file
    on disk grew from 1,388 to 1,484 bytes: the emulator had added the
    compiled block, exactly as a G2 does. That is what makes `pull` possible.

Process control (finding, closing and launching the emulator) is written for
Windows, which is where all of the above was measured. Everywhere else the
file half still works and the tool asks you to close the emulator yourself.

  --restart    close the emulator first, then open it again afterwards
  --exe PATH   where HPPrime.exe is, if it is not in the usual place

The emulator reads its folder when it starts, so a file copied into a
running one changes nothing until it is restarted. Rather than let that
happen quietly, this refuses -- pass --restart and it does the whole thing.

For a real calculator over USB there is still no way round the Connectivity
Kit: see docs/topics/deploy.md.

A clone is made from a calculator that has been used, not from nothing: a
folder the emulator has never finished setting up asks for a language on
every unlock and never gets past it. The clone gets its own identity in
`settings`, so it is not a second calculator claiming to be the first.

`reset` is the one that pays: a test that starts from a calculator in a
known state means something, and one that starts from wherever you left it
does not.
