# WAIT

Pauses for a number of seconds, or until a key is pressed.

## Examples

| Call | Result | Known from |
|---|---|---|
| `WAIT(1)` | *no value* | HP help |

## Behaviour

There is nothing to record: what it produces is a pause, and a batch that ran
it would only be slower (HP help). `hpprime run` answers 30 for this call,
which is the interpreter's own stand-in for a keypress and **not** evidence
about the calculator (unverified): the entry states no result rather than
that number.

**`WAIT(-1)` waits for a key and answers its code** (emulator): in a
program run from Home it waited twice, straight after the `[Enter]` that
started it and after the keyboard had been drained, and answered 42, the key
`1`, the only key tried,
[interface.wait-minus-one](../../topics/interface.md#interface.wait-minus-one).
One program on a G2 saw it not wait at all, and why is not known
(unverified).

What does work, measured, is to drain and then wait with
[GETKEY](GETKEY.md) (G2),
[interface.drain-then-wait](../../topics/interface.md#interface.drain-then-wait).
`WAIT(-1)` would use less battery and deliver touches in the same place;
the G2 reading is the reason to check it in your own program.
