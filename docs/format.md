# How this documentation is written

Every page under `docs/commands/` and `docs/topics/` follows the format on
this page, and a test holds each one to it. The documentation is meant to be
read by a person from start to finish and by a model one entry at a time, so
every entry stands on its own: nothing in it depends on having read the page
before.

## How each claim is known

Every example, and every statement about how a command behaves, carries one
of four labels, always in the same words:

| Label | What it means | What it needs |
|---|---|---|
| `G2` | measured on a physical HP Prime G2 | which program was run, on which firmware, and what the calculator showed |
| `emulator` | run on HP's Virtual Calculator | the stored result, and the firmware it came from |
| `HP help` | stated in the calculator's built-in help | the topic. Unless an entry says otherwise, this is the help dumped as Command Tree 13217 |
| `unverified` | none of the above | where it came from: a forum post, somebody's program, an inference |

They are listed from strongest to weakest. The emulator runs HP's own
firmware, so it is closer to the calculator than anything written for the PC,
but it is not the calculator. What the interpreter in this repository answers
is not evidence at all: the interpreter is checked against these labels, not
the other way round.

A label can link to its evidence. Where it does not, the entry says in words
where the evidence is.

What the Virtual Calculator answered is kept in `docs/commands/results.tsv`,
one row per example, with the version the calculator reported. `hpprime
examples` writes it; nobody edits it by hand. An example labelled `emulator`
has its row there. Any example that has a row states the answer the emulator
gave: when the two differ, the tests fail until a person settles which is
right, and nothing is replaced on its own. When the emulator confirms an
example labelled `HP help` or `unverified`, `hpprime examples --relabel`
changes its label to `emulator`; a `G2` label is never changed.

Every example has been run somewhere, or says why it cannot be. One with no
stored answer is *no value*, with the reason in its entry; or labelled `G2`,
with the evidence in its entry; or run through `hpprime run`, because its
command runs on the PC. The tests fail on anything else: an example nobody
has run is a claim nobody has checked.

## A command entry

One file per command, `docs/commands/<group>/<NAME>.md`, and nothing about
that command is written anywhere else. This is `LEFT`, shortened:

```markdown
# LEFT

The first n characters of a string.

| | |
|---|---|
| Syntax | `LEFT(str, n)` → string |
| Group | strings |
| Runs on the PC | yes |

## Examples

| Call | Result | Known from |
|---|---|---|
| `LEFT("abcdef", 3)` | `"abc"` | G2 |
| `LEFT("abcdef", 0)` | `"abcdef"` | G2 |
| `LEFT("MOMOGUMBO", 3)` | `"MOM"` | HP help |

## Behaviour

A count of 0 gives back the whole string, not an empty one, and so does a
count past the end (G2).
```

The parts, in this order:

1. **The name**, as the title, spelled the way PPL spells it. It is also the
   file's name and the entry's identifier.
2. **One sentence** saying what the command does. The index shows it.
3. **The fields**, in a two-column table:
   - `Syntax`: one row per form, with what it returns after `→`
   - `Group`: the folder the entry lives in
   - `Runs on the PC`: `yes` if `hpprime run` implements the command, `no` if
     it does not
4. **Examples**, in a table of three columns: the call, the result, and how
   the result is known.
   - The call and the result are PPL in backticks. The result is written the
     way the calculator displays it: `"abc"`, `{1,2}`, `[[1,2],[3,4]]`.
   - A call with a `;` in it is the body of a function, and its result is what
     that function answers. A call without one is an expression.
   - A result can be the word *error*, when the calculator refuses the call.
   - A result can be the words *no value*, when there is nothing to record:
     the command's result is the screen, or it stops the program, or it is a
     declaration rather than a call. Nothing runs such an example -- not
     `hpprime run`, not a batch on the emulator -- and the entry's behaviour
     says why there is nothing to record. It still carries a label, which says
     how the call itself is known.
   - Every example has exactly one label.
   - When the command runs on the PC, the tests run every example through
     `hpprime run` and compare the answer with the result stated.
5. **Behaviour**: short paragraphs for the edges and the errors. Every
   paragraph carries labels in parentheses, after the statements they
   support. The section can end with a paragraph that begins **Evidence.**
   and says where the labelled measurements come from; that one needs no
   label of its own.
6. **Models get wrong**, only when there is a record of it: what gets written,
   what happens, and where it was seen. An entry with no record has no such
   section, rather than a guessed one.
7. **Related**: links to other entries and to facts.

## A fact

A fact is something true about the platform rather than about one command: a
limit of the compiler, a key code, where a file has to go. It lives in the
topic page it belongs to, `docs/topics/<topic>.md`, and every command it
concerns links to it.

```markdown
<a name="ppl.local-limit"></a>
## One LOCAL statement holds at most 7 or 8 variables

| | |
|---|---|
| Identifier | `ppl.local-limit` |
| Kind | rule |
| Known from | G2 |

A `LOCAL` statement with more variables than that does not compile...

**Evidence.** Measured against programs that compile on the same
calculator...
```

- The anchor and the `Identifier` field are the same: the topic, a dot, and a
  short slug.
- `Kind` is `rule`, or `refuted hypothesis` for something that looked like a
  rule and was measured to be false. A refuted hypothesis is stated as what is
  true, and it is kept, because a model that has read only the rules will
  invent the missing ones.
- `Known from` is one label.
- Then the statement, and a paragraph that begins **Evidence.**

## Identifiers

- A command's identifier is its name: `LEFT`, `TEXTOUT_P`. A statement is
  named by its first word: `FOR`, `IF`, `IFERR`.
- A function or a variable that belongs to an app is qualified by the app, as
  in `Function.AREA`.
- A fact's identifier is its topic and a slug, as in `ppl.local-limit`.
- An identifier does not change once it is published. A rename leaves the old
  one pointing at the new.

## The list of names

`docs/commands/names.tsv` holds every name PPL has, one per line, in six
tab-separated fields: the name, its kind, the group HP files it under, its
menu, the syntax HP's help gives for it, and where it came from. It is built
from HP's own sources: the help of firmware 13217, the command tree of
2.1.14181, and the release notes up to 2.4.15515. `tests/names_extract.py`
says how to rebuild it.

- Every entry's name is on the list, and its folder is the group the list
  gives it.
- Statements, commands, functions, app functions, app variables and
  variables each get an entry. Keywords are covered by the entry of their
  statement, operators by the topic page on the language, and CAS is not
  documented here.

## What is generated

These pages are produced, and nobody edits them by hand:

- `docs/commands/<group>.md`: every entry of a group on one page, for reading
  straight through
- `docs/commands/index.md`: every name on the list that gets an entry, with,
  for those already written, its sentence and the weakest label among its
  examples
- `docs/commands/groups.md`: the same names under the groups HP files them
  in
- `docs/llms.txt`: every fact and every entry on one line, with its link and
  its one-line summary, in the llms.txt layout, for a model to load before
  anything else. It is loaded whole, so it has a budget of 100,000 bytes, and
  the tests fail past it

`hpprime docs` regenerates them, and the tests fail when one is out of date.
